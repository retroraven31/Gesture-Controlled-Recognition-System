### **Required Hardware Components:**
- **Raspberry Pi 4 Model B**: Central processing unit for handling media control and gesture recognition.
- **Pi Camera Module**: A high-definition camera interface designed for real-time image acquisition and gesture tracking.
- **MicroSD Card** (with **Raspbian OS Buster** installed): Storage medium containing the necessary OS and software for processing.
- **Ethernet Cable**: For network connectivity, enabling software updates and media streaming.
- **USB-C Power Supply**: To power the Raspberry Pi and associated peripherals.

### **Key Features:**

- **Hands-Free Interaction**: This gesture-controlled system eliminates the need for traditional input devices, empowering users to interact with media devices purely through body language.
- **Intuitive Gesture Recognition**: The system interprets basic hand movements, including swipes, gestures, and postures, as user commands, translating them into corresponding media controls such as play, pause, volume adjustments, and track navigation.
- **Real-Time Gesture Processing**: Utilizing the combined capabilities of machine learning and computer vision, the system processes hand gestures in real-time, ensuring low-latency control and a seamless user experience.

### **Supported Gestures:**
1. **Open Hand**: Initiates media playback (**Play**).
2. **Closed Fist**: Pauses media playback (**Pause**).
3. **Index Finger Moving Right**: Fast forward media playback.
4. **Index Finger Moving Left**: Rewind media playback.
5. **Two Fingers Moving Up**: Increases volume.
6. **Two Fingers Moving Down**: Decreases volume.
